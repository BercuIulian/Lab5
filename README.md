this is a tower defence simulation. the only think you will have to input is the nr of each troops that are going to atack your base and the number of towers that will defend it. the simulation will run by its own and will dicide by some critiries what to do in some cases. at the end of the simulation it provides you with some information like the result of the game (victory/lose) and the in game time that the simulation lasted. each troop has its own range as well as the towers so not every tower will be able to atack the troops, thats what makes this simulation interesting.
